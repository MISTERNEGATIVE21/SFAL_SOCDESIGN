# SFAL_SOCDESIGN  
**A Step-by-Step Journey in SoC Design**  

## Overview  
Digital chip design is a multi-step process that transforms a high-level functional specification into a fully manufacturable silicon chip. It begins with defining the design requirements, followed by **Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding** using hardware description languages like **Verilog or VHDL**. The RTL design is then verified to ensure functional correctness before being synthesized into a gate-level netlist.  

Once synthesized, the **physical design phase** begins, which includes **floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing** to create the actual chip layout. After routing, the design undergoes extensive **timing analysis, power optimization, and physical verification** (DRC/LVS) to ensure manufacturability. The final design is then prepared for **GDSII tapeout**, marking the transition from design to fabrication.  

This repository provides a **structured, hands-on guide** through the **RTL-to-GDSII** flow using **Synopsys tools**. Each stage is covered in detail, offering insights into **design optimization, best practices, and industry-standard methodologies** to help users efficiently navigate the SoC design process.
