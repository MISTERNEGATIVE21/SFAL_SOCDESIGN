# SFAL SOC Design Journey
This repository captures my journey through the SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design program organized by NASSCOM, where I gained hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge in the field of system-on-chip (SoC) design. The program covers a wide range of VLSI and SoC development topics, providing practical, project-based learning opportunities that enhance both technical skills and understanding of industry-standard methodologies in chip design.
